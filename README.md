# MSM QUERIES DEBUG

## Debug Query Methods

There are methods defined in the following models: `movie.rb`, `director.rb`, and `actor.rb`.

Currently, none of them work. If you look in each of the mentioned model files, you'll see that methods have been defined, but the contents of the methods are commented out. Each method is broken in some way.

Uncomment each one ONE AT A TIME and make it work.

Let me say that again:


#### Uncomment each method ONE AT A TIME and debug it

**ONE**

**AT**

**A**

**TIME**

If you uncomment them all at once, you'll have lots of problems because they all have bugs in them.

At least one bug has been planted into each method.

YOUR JOB: Debug all 11 query methods.
